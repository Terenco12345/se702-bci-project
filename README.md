## Experiment preparations
Ensure that all the experiment is conducted in a quiet environment as the Neurosky Mindwave is susceptible to noise.

Provide each participant with a participant ID and ensure the headset to attached properly to the partipant's head and the clip is placed onto the ear lobe with the wire correctly going behind the ear.

Execute the python script and enter the partipant and task ID.

Ensure that data recording is started before experiment begins.

Open the application UI for the participant.

Ensure the participant reads the PIS and consent form and has the opporunity to ask questions before starting the experiment.

## System Requirements 
In order to run the project locally, you must ensure you have setup, installed and tested:

-   `git`
-   `node.js`
-   `python3`
-   `Neurosky Mindwave driver`

This implementation is fully supported and tested on Windows 10
